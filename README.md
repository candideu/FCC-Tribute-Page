# FCC-Tribute-Page
Here is my submission for Free Code Camp's [Tribute Page challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) (HTML + CSS Certificate).

I decided to create a page for the amazing [Tierra Whack](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7v_YlS5RVfKPe8sWfN406A)! I experimented with overlapping objects (text overlapping with an image), custom fonts, and parallax (using JQuery).

## Fonts used
[Sporting Grotesque](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/sporting-grotesque/)  
[Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
[Source Serif Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro)
